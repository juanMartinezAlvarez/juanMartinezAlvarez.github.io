Hello, I'm Juan, an industrial engineer originally from Uruguay, with a specialization in electrical engineering. While working in industry, I discovered my passion for research, leading me to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in physics.  During this journey, I delved into the optical properties of a wide variety of nanostructured materials, ranging from semiconductor nanorods to insect wings. Currently, I'm on the brink of defending my dissertation and eagerly anticipating a new venture in semiconductor physics and circuit design.

My interests lie in Solid State Physics, particularly electric and thermal transport, optical properties of materials and optics. I am also passionate about electronics and circuit design. If these areas resonate with you or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

In my leisure time, I indulge in reading, painting, and music. I also enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and playing football (soccer for visitors from the USA), a true Latin American pastime. I'm constantly on the lookout for new music; there's nothing quite like the thrill of discovering a new favorite. So, even if our research paths don't align, I'd love to hear your recommendations.
