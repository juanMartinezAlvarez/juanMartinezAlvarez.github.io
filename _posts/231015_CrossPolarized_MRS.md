This is an example post with image galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

The beautiful iridescent colors in soap bubbles and oil slicks on water are caused by interference color. This is a phenomenon where colors are produced through the constructive and destructive interference of light waves. This occurs when light is reflected from or transmitted through thin films, layers, or structures with thicknesses comparable to the wavelength of light.
When light traverses a thin film, there are multiple reflections and transmissions at each boundary, with the total reflection and transmission the sum of each individually transmitted and reflected waves, as shown in the diagram below. 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.
