	abstract = {Polarization-sensitive color originates from polarizationdependent reflection or transmission, exhibiting abundant light information, including intensity, spectral distribution, and polarization. A wide range of butterflies are physiologically sensitive to polarized light, but the origins of polarized signal have not been fully understood. Here we systematically investigate the colorful scales of six species of butterfly to reveal the physical origins of polarization-sensitive color. Microscopic optical images under crossed polarizers exhibit their polarization-sensitive characteristic, and micro-structural characterizations clarify their structural commonality. In the case of the structural scales that have deep ridges, the polarizationsensitive color related with scale azimuth is remarkable. Periodic ridges lead to the anisotropic effective refractive indices in the parallel and perpendicular grating orientations, which achieves form-birefringence, resulting in the phase difference of two different component polarized lights. Simulated results show that ridge structures with reflecting elements reflect and rotate the incident p-polarized light into s-polarized light. The dimensional parameters and shapes of grating greatly affect the polarization conversion process, and the triangular deep grating extends the outstanding polarization conversion effect from the sub-wavelength period to the period comparable to visible light wavelength. The parameters of ridge structures in butterfly scales have been optimized to fulfill the polarization-dependent reflection for secret communication. The structural and physical origin of polarization conversion provides a more comprehensive perspective on the creation of polarization-sensitive color in butterfly wing scales. These findings show great potential in anti-counterfeiting technology and advanced optical material design.},

	abstract = {The accurate determination of sample thickness is crucial for its comprehensive characterization in materials science. Interference oscillations in optical spectra offer a simple method to achieve this, relying on the sample’s preservation of light coherence. However, conventional spectra may fail to exhibit these oscillations in numerous samples due to factors such as high transparency, anisotropy, or scattering caused by nanostructures. In this study, we implement a crossed polarization spectral transmittance measurement which successfully unveils hidden interference oscillations by exploiting the polarization conversion characteristics in the wing of the Episcada hymenaea translucent butterfly. We compare the thickness measurements obtained using this method with those derived from Scanning Electron Microscopy and find a relative difference as low as 5\% as well as high robustness against variations in the refractive index.},

	abstract = {We provide a detailed discussion on the electromagnetic modeling and classiﬁcation of polarization converting bianisotropic metasurfaces. To do so, we ﬁrst present a general approach to compute the scattering response of such metasurfaces, which relies on a generalized sheet transition conditions based susceptibility model. Then, we review how the fundamental properties of reciprocity, energy conservation, rotation invariance and matching may be expressed in terms of metasurface susceptibilities and scattering parameters, and show how these properties may affect and limit the polarization effects of metasurfaces. Finally, we connect together the metasurface susceptibility model to the structural symmetries of scattering particles and their associated polarization effects. This work thus provides a detailed understanding of the polarization conversion properties of metasurfaces and may prove to be of particular interest for their practical implementation.},
