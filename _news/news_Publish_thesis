I have successfully defended my thesis and obtained a masterâ€™s in engineering-Physics. In my work I delved on the relationship between optical properties and morphology of nanostructured materials. You can access the final manuscript <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381041132_Light_propagation_in_multilayered_nanostructures?channel=doi&linkId=665a40650b0d28457479a1d3&showFulltext=true'>here</a>! :sparkles: :smile:.
