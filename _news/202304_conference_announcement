I will be presenting a poster at the second Meeting of Researchers in Materials Science (<a href='https://eicm.cure.edu.uy/'>ECIM</a>) in Montevideo, Uruguay. On the 21st of April I will be available to discuss the recent work we have been doing in collaboration with the Entomology and Analytical Biochemistry groups of the Faculty of Sciences on the remarkable transparency in the wings of the `_Episcada hymenaea_` translucent butterfly, autochthonous to Uruguay. We have found that the transparency could be attributed to a gradient index introduced through random nanostructures in the wing surface. Furthermore, polarization conversion effects were visible.

Be sure to pass by my stand to see some pretty butterflies!
